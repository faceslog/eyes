## Simple Face Detection with OpenCV

<br/>The bash script will take care of installing OpenCV and its necessary dependencies.

Anyways if an error occur you can still add the submodules by using these commands:

`git submodule add https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git opencv`

`git submodule add https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib.git opencv_contrib`
